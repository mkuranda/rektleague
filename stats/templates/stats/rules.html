<h2>Rekt League Intro</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>We want the Rekt League to be an environment in which players of varying skill levels can play in an organized and competitive environment with their friends. The goal of this league is to bring a level of professionalism, production value, and structure to players.  We want to give people an experience/community they want to be a part of. While we know there are issues with creating competitive environments including players of varying skill levels, our goal is to mitigate as many of those issues as possible to allow for friends to play together.</p>

<h3>Honor Code</h3>
<p>Certain things come along with the skill diversity that makes the Rekt League great, including the opportunity to take advantage of it. When there is a rule in place, sometimes it can be easy to get around, but it is there for a reason. Most are there to ensure that everyone can have a good experience, regardless of skill level. </p>
<p>League of Legends is a game we take fairly seriously, which naturally brings frustration during competition.  That being said, our rules and standards are honor based. Meaning, we trust in players/teams to be honest with us about player-facing issues such as registering all accounts, account sharing, smurfing, etc.  Punishments for violating our rules are detailed further, later in this rulebook.</p>

<h3>Why it Works</h3>
<p>The Rekt League works because we are a league of players who respect the other players and teams in the league not just as players, but also as people. We strive to be a positive community where people can throw some smack talk around, but are always able to say “GG WP” and tip the hat to the other team.  We aren’t about putting individuals on blast in the Facebook group or making your team uncomfortable when you say stuff in bad taste in your games. The goal is to not be a D-Bag to your team or to the community and keep things fun and tasteful. In addition, it works because we do have what might seem like arbitrary or stricter rules than other leagues when it comes to roster balance, roster lock, and subs. But, we believe that by having these rules we can allow people to go into games feeling like they can be reasonably prepared for their matches. Keep in mind, none of us are LCS level and we’re not practicing 11 hours a day on counter picks and versatility. We reasonably expect teams to practice once to a couple times a week and have some weekly discussions about the weekend matches, but at the end of the day this is for fun and not our jobs.</p>

<h3>3rd Party Help</h3>

<ol>
    <li>The Rekt League has no way of monitoring if you’re using any kind of 3rd party software that’s designed to give you in-game advantages. So if you are thinking about using any, ask yourself “why am I doing this?” and then just don’t.</li>
    <li>Anything that breaks Riot’s ToS, OR would get you banned, is not allowed in the Rekt League.</li>
</ol>

<a id="format"></a>
<h2>Rekt League Format</h2>

<h3>Regular Season</h3>

<p>Conferences and Game Days</p>
<ul>
    <li>Teams will be split into 2 separate conferences (Jungle and River)</li>
    <li>Matches will be played primarily intra-conference, with 2 inter-conference matches per team in the regular season.</li>
    <li>4 matches will be played per Sunday.</li>
    <li>Each team will have one bye week.</li>
    <li>Due to overflow, 2 matches will be played on two given Thursdays following State of the League during the regular season, Week 3 and Week 6.</li>
</ul>

<p>Best of Two</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each team plays 2 games each Sunday against one other team.</li>
    <li>Rosters need to be locked ahead of time for both games by the Wednesday night 11:59pm EST before each Sunday.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each <strong>MATCH</strong> will allow a 15 minute grace period. </p>
<ul>
    <li>If a full roster isn’t fielded by the end of the 15 minute period, it will result in a 0-2 for the late team. (If both teams are late, 1-1).</li>
    <li>Once the first game is given up, the second cannot be played.</li>
    <li>The 15 minute grace period begins when the caster’s countdown ends (same for the second game)</li>
    <li>Games not played are not allowed to be rescheduled.</li>
    <li>Exceptions are natural disasters, Riot server-wide lag, or other major events with an effect on our player population.</li>
    <li>If a single player cannot attend a game they were scheduled in, a substitute is able to be used. *Note: Substitutes have their own section see <a href="#rosters">here</a></li>
</ul>

<p>When the first game in a match is completed, after the producer returns from break, they will start a 15 minute timer, this will be the grace period to field a roster for the second match.</p>

<p>All champions trades must be completed before the 20 second mark after all 10 champions have been locked in (LCS rule)</p>

<p>Side selection is determined by win %. The team with the lower win % chooses which side they want for game 1, then for game 2, the sides are swapped. *Note: A tied win % results in a coin flip determination</p>

<p>Pauses: each team is allowed half of the total pause timer (15 min total pause time for each team).</p>

<h3>Schedule</h3>

<p>See the Season {{ season.id }} schedule <a target="_blank" class="linkStyle" href="/season/{{ season.id }}/schedule/">here</a>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Please note who the producer is for your game. If you’re planning on making a hype video, send it to <strong>therektleague@gmail.com</strong></li>
</ul>

<a id="playoffs"></a>
<h3>Playoffs</h3>
<p>Playoff Seeding</p>
<ul>
	<li>Playoff seeding will be determined by the following factors in order:</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Regular Season Win Percentage</li>
		<li>Head to Head Win Percentage</li>
		<li>Average Win Time</li>
		<li>Bits Donated (Just kidding)</li>
	</ol>
</ul>

<p>Playoff Structure</p>
<ul>
    <li>Top 4 teams from each conference make the playoffs (8 teams in playoffs total).</li>
	<li>Playoffs will be played as a double elimination bracket.</li>
	<li>Winners side games will be Bo3.</li>
	<li>Elimination side games will be Bo1 until Semifinals in which they become Bo3.<li>
	<li>Finals will be Bo7. Winners side will enter with 1 win.</li>
</ul>

<p>Special Playoff Rules</p>
<ul>
	<li>Each game will allow a 30 minute grace period. If a team can't field a roster after the time limit, that team will forfeit the first game and a new 30 minute grace period will start. After the second grace period, that team will forfeit the series.</li>
	<li>The team with the higher seeding gets side selection for game 1, with sides alternating each game after.</li>
</ul>

<p>In playoffs, our main goal is to make sure that all games get played and are as competitive as possible. We tend to be more lenient around emergency situations to allow teams to have a satisfying conclusion to their season.</p>

<a id="rosters"></a>
<h2>Rosters</h2>

<p>***<strong>Please do not change your main account summoner name</strong>, it messes up the casters and people trying to research. If you change the name of one of your alternate accounts, make sure that you update the name on your profile ASAP. Failing to do so will result in your account becoming an Unregistered Account. See <a href="#punishments">Punishments section</a> for details.***</p>

<h3>Ranked requirements</h3>

<p>New Players - There are <strong>two</strong> ranked requirements that must be completed before a new player is allowed to sign up for The Rekt League</p>
<ul>
    <li>Have a total of 50 ranked solo/duo queue games played in the current competitive season.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Flex queue/rank is not counted so that teams formed before the team creation point can play flex reliably without increasing their ELO above the limit.</li>
        <li>A large enough disparity between solo/duo and flex rank may be evaluated for establishing a new rank on a case by case basis for new players, per admin discretion.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Have a highest achieved all-time rank between a minimum of Silver 3 and a maximum of Diamond 3.</li>
    <li>Currently ranked at least Silver 3 in ranked solo/duo.</li>
</ul>

<p>Returning Players </p>
<ul>
    <li>Have a total of 50 <strong>solo/duo</strong> queue games played in the current competitive season.</li>
    <li>Have a highest achieved all-time rank between a minimum of Silver 3 and a maximum of Diamond 3.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Roster Lock</h3>

<p>Roster Lock Deadline</p>
<ul>
	<li>Rosters for the upcoming week must be submitted before Wednesday 11:59PM EST.</li>
	<li>Each team's roster will be revealed to their opponents after the deadline has passed.</li>
	<li>See <a href="#punishments">Punishments section</a> for details on a team that misses the Roster Lock Deadline.</li>
</ul>

<p>Submitting a Roster</p>
<ul>
	<li>It is the Team Representative's job to lock in their team's roster for the week using their account here.</li>
	<li>A legal roster contains one active player for each of the five roles, and up to one Scheduled Substitute. The Roster ELO Average must be below the League ELO Average.</li>
	<li>You can find more information about ELO Averages and Substitues below.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Roster Balance</h3>

<p>League ELO Average</p>
<ul>
	<li>Every season, we choose a League ELO Average based on the average rank of players that sign up. We use this to calculate ELO Values.</li>
	<li>For Season {{ season.id }}, we will be using <strong>Gold 1</strong> as the League ELO Average.</p>
</ul>

<p>ELO Value</p>
<ul>
	<li>In the Rekt League, we assign a numerical value to each rank that you can achieve in League of Legends. We call this number an ELO Value.</li>
	<li>ELO Values are defined as the number of ranks away a player is from the League ELO Average.</li>
	<li>Each ELO Value for a rank above the League ELO Average is positive, while each ELO Value for a rank below the League ELO Average is negative.</li>
</ul>

<p>Roster Average ELO</p>
<ul>
    <li>To determine a roster's Average ELO, you simply average the ELO Value of each individual player on the roster. A roster is only legal to be played in the Rekt League if its Average ELO is 0 or below.</li>
	<li>Any substitutions that a team makes must result in a roster with a legal Average ELO.</li>
</ul>

<p>Player ELO Value</p>
<ul>
    <li>A player's ELO Value for the season is determined by an admin after they submit a sign up for the season. A player's ELO Value is locked for the season, so if they improve and climb over the course of the season, their ELO Value will not change. The only time that an ELO Value can change during a season is if a player new to the Rekt League is found to be grossly misvalued at the beginning of the season.</li>
	<li>In order to determine a player's ELO Value, we look for the highest rank the player has achieved at the end of any season or their current solo queue ranking across all of their accounts. We use <a target="_blank" class="linkStyle" href="https://na.op.gg">OP.GG</a> to do this.</li>
    <li>If a player's highest all-time ranking is the fifth rank in a division (i.e. Gold 5) from back when those existed, we set their ELO Value as if they had achieved the fourth rank in that division today (i.e. Gold 4)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Substitutes</h3>

<p>General Substitute Rules</p>
<ul>
	<li>Any time you make a substitution, your Roster ELO Average still cannot be over 0.</li>
    <li>Substitutes must be direct role replacements. You may not do any other role swaps to accommodate a substitute. <strong>For example</strong>: My substitute is a support main, but our jungler bailed. The substitute must directly play the role of the person who couldn’t make the match. Time for some Soraka jungle.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each team is allowed to lock in a single substitute each week, called a <em>Scheduled Substitute</em>. Each week you can lock in a 6-man roster!</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Scheduled Substitute</strong>: A player who you want to be able to substitute in between games for strategic purposes.</li>
    <li>If a player is subbed out, they may sub back in later in the series, but must play the same position.</li>
    <li>The starting lineup should play game 1 of the series.</li>
</ul>
<a id="esubs"></a>
<p>Emergency Substitutes</p>
<ul>
	<li>If one or more of your players is unable to show up on game day, you may need to use an Emergency Substitute.</li>
	<li>In order to find an Emergency Substitute during the regular season, follow the guidelines below:</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Use another available player on your roster that fulfills the ELO requirements.</li>
		<li>Use an available player on another team that is not starting this week.</li>
		<li>If a suitable replacement cannot be found using the steps above, you may use a player on another team that is scheduled to play this week.</li>
	</ol>
	<li>If you cannot field a legal roster using the Emergency Substitute guidelines, your match will result in a 2-0 for your opponent.</li>
	<li>During playoffs, you may only use players on your roster to make an Emergency Substitution.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Roster Additions/Movement</h3>

<p><strong>Roster freeze deadline</strong>: All trades or recruitment must be completed by the roster lock  on the last week of play during the regular season. (For Season 7 this date is 11/4/2020)</p>

<p>Roster Changes</p>
<ul>
    <li>You may trade and/or add players to your roster as long as they stay within the following guidelines:</li>

    <ol>
        <li>You may only have 10 players on your roster.</li>
        <li>The only way to change those 10 players is to trade them to another team (or multiple teams) for a player on another roster.</li>
    </ol>

    <li>Roster movements are executed through the site. That means the existing player has to be removed and resubmit a sign up to enter the Free Agent database. Then they can be invited to a new team. You can only get new players from the Free Agent Database not direct trades.</li>

    <li>Teams cannot withhold players from moving to another team if they desire to.</li>
    <li>In order to play in a given week, a player must have been a member of that team since at least the Roster Lock Deadline for that week.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are no limits to the number of trades for teams or players</p>

<a id="ff"></a>
<h2>Game Day</h2>

<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>All teams are required to be in their voice channel in the Rekt League Discord during Rekt League games. Only the 5 players playing are allowed in that channel during champ select or in game.</p>
<p>As someone not playing, you may only communicate with the players between games, you may not join their Discord channel, send ingame messages, or communicate in any other way with players during the games. See <a href="#punishments">Punishments section</a> for details</p>

<h3>Forfeiting</h3>

<p>For the sake of us making content, players being able to feel like they earned a win fully, and the belief that throws can happen, we ask you not to surrender games. Everyone invests time to be at the game; from the casters, to the viewers, to the other team's players. Don’t waste their time by surrendering.</p>

<a id="punishments"></a>
<h2>Punishments</h2>

<h3>Playing with an Unregistered Account</h3>

<p>Unregistered Account</p>
<ul>
	<li>An Unregistered Account is an active player's League of Legends account at level 30 or above that is found after the season starts and is not listed correctly on their profile.</li>
	<li>In order for an account to be listed correctly, it must be listed on the site and link to the correct op.gg.</li>
	<li>Some examples of Unregistered Accounts are accounts that are spelled incorrectly, accounts that have had their names changed, and accounts that are ommitted.</li>
	<li>If an active player for the current season changes the name of one of their accounts, it is their responsibility to update the corresponding account here within a week to avoid it becoming an Unregistered Account.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unregistered Account Categories</p>
<ul>
	<li>Category 1: An account that would have resulted in us assigning the player a higher ELO Value.</li>
	<li>Category 2: An account that would not have affected the player's ELO Value, but has games played on it within the past month.</li>
	<li>Category 3: An account that would not have affected the player's ELO Value, but has no games played on it within the past month.</li>
</ul>

<p>Category 1 Unregistered Account - Punishments</p>
<ul>
	<li>The offending player will receive a Swift Ass Ban</li>
	<li>We will investigate whether the Team Representative or other team members knew about the account, and assign punishments accordingly</li>
</ul>

<p>Category 2 Unregistered Account - Punishments</p>
<ul>
	<li>The offending player will receive a One Week Suspension</li>
</ul>

<p>Unregistered Category 3 Account - Punishments</p>
<ul>
	<li>First Offense this Season: No punishment if the player fixes the Unregistered Account within a week.</li>
	<li>Further Offenses: The offending player will receive a One Week Suspension</li>
</ul>

<h3>Roster Lock</h3>

<p>Missing roster locks results in punishments as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>After the first offense of missing roster lock, teams will be penalized bans <strong>IN THE FIRST BAN PHASE ONLY</strong> in the following order:</li>

    <ol>
        <li>First missed roster lock offense = no ban restrictions</li>
        <li>Second missed roster lock offense = 1 ban removed from game 1</li>
        <li>Third missed roster lock offense = 1 ban removed from each game</li>
        <li>Fourth missed roster lock offense = 2 bans removed from game 1, AND 1 ban removed from game 2.</li>
        <li>...etc until all bans are removed.</li>
    </ol>
</ul>

<p>These punishments only apply during a week that a roster lock was missed.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If a team missed roster lock in week 1, 2 and 3, but didn’t miss week 4, during the week 4 games they get all their bans.</li>
    <li>If they miss again in week 5, they would have missed 4 total locks, and would only have 1 first round ban, in game 1., and 2 in game 2</li>
</ul>

<p>Only first round bans are affected.</p>

<p>This only applies to the regular season</p>

<h3>Communicating with In Game Players</h3>
<p>If a non-player is found communicating with a player during one of their Rekt League games, depending on the severity of any information or other advice given, punishments can range up to expulsion from the league.</p>
<p>Just don't do it, man.</p>


<h3>Roster above the ELO Limit</h3>

<p>If a team (including substitutes) is absolutely unable to field an eligible roster on game day, that team forfeits the entire match.</p>

<h3>Toxicity in zombie scrims/inhouse events</h3>

<p>Aggressive verbal harassment, intentionally feeding, or griefing zombie scrims may result in a personal 1 week ban from the league.</p>

<ul>
    <li>These reports would need to be backed up with video/audio evidence.</li>
    <li>The atmosphere/seriousness of the games would also be taken into account.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changing your summoner name</h3>

<p>If you change your summoner name mid season and don't update your profile, you run the risk of our tournament codes rejecting your new summoner name on game day. </p>
<p>If you do change your summoner name UPDATE YOUR PROFILE IMMEDIATELY. If you don't then other teams won't be able to research your account. If you fail to update your account name before that weeks game day you will be suspended for that week and so on until you fix the account name.</p>

<h3>Code of conduct</h3>

<p>Toxicity is not allowed. Between teams or between players. Know your audience.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hype videos and trash talk videos are fine. But again, know your audience. Don’t make a trash talk video of someone you don’t know. Don’t make one and release it AFTER you beat them.</li>
    <li>Toxicity is more than just verbal abuse, it's team environment, sarcasm, or simply being rude.</li>
    <li>Toxicity reports require validation, video and/or audio</li>
    <li>Ban period begins at 1 week, but will increase based on severity and repetition</li>
    <li>Toxicity can result in a permaban from the league.</li>
</ul>

<p>No hate speech</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hate speech reports require validation, video,audio, or screenshot.</li>
    <li>Hate speech is defined as: any kind of communication in speech, writing or behaviour, that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group on the basis of who they are, in other words, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, descent, gender or other identity factor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Toxicity in any form from a Team Rep is further prohibited. Team reps are expected to know and uphold this rulebook in its entirety</p>

<ul>
    <li>Failure to act accordingly will first result in up to two warnings (severity dependent)</li>
    <li>Continued violations will result in expulsion from the league.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Removed teams will have all matches expunged from the record, and future matches converted to a bye week</li>
        <li>The team captain will not be allowed to return to play in the rekt league in a future season</li>
        <li>Other players will be free to join another team, or play in another season</li>
        <li>This may cause the Rekt League Schedule to be adjusted</li>
    </ol>
</ul>

<p>Reporting players toxicity is well within Rekt League players rights, all players should feel able to reach out to any league admin for more information. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Primary player relations contacts are Darth Ted Icicli. Or just email therektleague@gmail.com</li>
    <li>Players should feel free to reach out to admin for issues without fear of reprisal</li>
</ul>

<a id="swaps"></a>
<h2>Lane Swaps</h2>

<p>A lane swap is defined in The Rekt League as a player selecting a champion in champ select and opting to start the game in a different position. Based off how early laning phases can have large impacts on the game teams could abuse lane swaps to put their players into match ups against lower ELO players to funnel more gold into them. While we want to encourage players to play their style, The Rekt League is balanced around ELO values and being able to prepare for your match ups ahead of time. Not knowing if you're going to start off the game laning against a Diamond player as a Silver creates a frustrating game experience.</p>

<p>However, we do recognize that the meta shifts and sometimes rotating players around the map to apply pressure to  objectives is just good <em>League of Legends</em>.</p>

<p><strong>The Rule:</strong> Lane swaps pre-5 minutes (when turret fortification falls) are NOT allowed. You must spend more time in your lane than any member of your team who is not assigned to that lane. Junglers are excluded from this.</p>

<h3>Punishment</h3>

<p>First offesnse is two missed bans in your next series. Second offense is a match loss for the game the offense occured. If this happens during a playoff series we will take the time to review after the match and apply the punishment to the next applicable game.</p>

<h3>Clarity</h3>

<p>We don’t have “solo lane” as a role, your role is mid lane or top lane.</p>
<p>Play the role assigned to you during the roster lock in every Wednesday.</p>
<p>You <strong>can</strong> play a different role every week, as long as you are locked in as that role on the Wednesday roster lock.</p>

<a id="reality"></a>
<h2>The Reality of Competitive Play</h2>

<h3>Pick/Ban</h3>

<p>Our pick/ban uses the client tournament draft system (3 bans per team, 3 picks per team, 2 bans per team, two picks per team; with Blue side having first pick, Red side last pick)</p>
<p>The pick/ban phase of a game should be used to help mitigate player/role skill differences, don’t just ban the OP’s of the patch. Do your research to get your Silver 3 player a sick counterpick!</p>
<p>If you are a 1 trick pony, expect your 1 trick to always be banned. This is the reality you’re going to have to live with in competitive play, over performing and climbing to a high rank on a single champ doesn’t mean a whole lot when the other team has 5 bans.</p>

<p>Consider 2 tricking?</p>

<h3>Memes and Trash Talk</h3>

<p>The Rekt Leagues opinion about trash talk align with Team Liquids ADC, Doublelift in an interview he had with The Shotcaller. Full quote as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Speaking to your notoriousness, you’ve been renowned to be a trash talker. Do you think this is necessary within the league? Do you think more players should embrace the art of trash talk?</em></strong></p>

<p>I think talking trash is fun for the viewers and fun if you enjoy having extra pressure on yourself to perform. A lot of people go about it wrong. They’re waiting until after they win, like, “haha that team was shit”. It’s like when Jensen beat us and he tweeted…well…this is why everyone memes his tweet, “I thought Team Liquid were supposed to be good”, AFTER they beat us.</p>

<p><strong>In my opinion, the best way to trash talk is before the match because you’re betting that you could be wrong.</strong> When you say we’re going to shit on these guys, we’re going to beat them and it’s gonna be free…then you open up yourself to be wrong and looking like an idiot, while also opening up the possibility of being right and being cocky, yet you can back it up. Someone that waits for a win and kicks them while they’re down, it’s not cool. That’s not even trash talk, that’s just being an asshole. I try to trash talk before the game to bring hype. After you see your favorite player win, kicking someone while they’re down, that’s not hype, that’s just…eh? That doesn’t make me feel good personally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Full article can be found <a class="linkStyle" href="https://theshotcaller.net/doublelift-on-proper-trash-talk/" target="_blank">here</a></p>

<p>The reality of trash talk is it’s great when done correctly, and makes you look like a huge douche when it’s not. So trash talk and meme your enemy <strong>before</strong> the game! Remember, it's a game, and the Rekt League is a bunch of real people so don’t kick them when they’re down.</p>

<a id="misc"></a>
<h2>Misc</h2>

<p>New and reworked champions must have been available for 7 days before being played in The Rekt League.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reworked champs are defined by Riots in the patch notes each patch. These are not balance changes.</li>
    <li>Applies to gameplay updates, champion reworks, new champions</li>
</ul>

<a id="subs"></a>
<h2>Rekt League Subscriptions</h2>

<p>In order to be eligible to play in Rekt League events, unless the event details specifically says otherwise, players will be asked to pay The Rekt League Membership subscription fee. You will be billed monthly for <strong>$2.99</strong> starting the day you subscribe and charging you a month from that day (not at beginning of the month). This goes for <strong>ANY</strong> rostered player playing in The Rekt League, Sub Leagues, TFTuesdays etc.</p>

<p>Players <strong>WILL NOT</strong> be eligible to be locked in if they have not paid their subscription. We ask that you do so before your match. If a player does not or refuses to pay the fee, then the team cannot play them and has to use an <a href="#esubs">emergency sub</a>.</p>

<h3>Canceling Subscriptions</h3>

<p>You are more than welcome to cancel or suspend your subscription during the months you are not engaging in The Rekt League.

<p>The rules are not a finished product! When needed things will change! When discovered, rules will be added! Even after 7 seasons, we’re still learning! We experiment and figure out what works and what doesn’t. We don’t have teams of analysts ready to pounce on the best methods to run a skill diverse League of Legends tournament league. But one thing is certain, we will Rekt this book into shape.</p>

<p>Money that gets paid to The Rekt League is non-refundable, but mugs are forever. Cheers!</p>
